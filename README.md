My small pet project which is an open platform for posting jokes in the public domain. It has the ability to register, 
publish jokes and display the jokes you have posted on your account, and by swiping left or right on the main screen, add the joke you like to your account. 

The application is written in Kotlin using the following libraries:
Dagger2
JetPack Navigation
Room(future)
Lifecycle (livedata,viewModel,runtime)

The ability to register, store posts and accounts is implemented using FireBase. FireBase FireStore is used to store posts, Realtime DataBase is used for accounts
